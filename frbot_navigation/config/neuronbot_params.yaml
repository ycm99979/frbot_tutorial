"# Split parameter files"
"# This file is left as an index/reference. The original big parameter file has been split into multiple files
"# located in the same directory. To load them in a launch file, provide a list of parameter files to the node,
"# for example: params=[Path('param/amcl.yaml'), Path('param/controller.yaml'), ...]

parameter_files:
  - amcl.yaml
  - bt_navigator.yaml
  - controller.yaml
  - local_costmap.yaml
  - global_costmap.yaml
  - map.yaml
  - planner.yaml
  - smoother.yaml
  - behavior.yaml
  - robot_state_publisher.yaml
  - waypoint_follower.yaml

# Note: ROS 2 does not support YAML include natively. Keep thisㅏ index for humans and launch-file reference.
# If you want, I can also automatically update the launch files to reference these parameter files.
